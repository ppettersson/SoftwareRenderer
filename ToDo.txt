- Use function pointers and a startup function that checks CPU type and assigns the right functions.
- Use NASM/YASM/ (MASM?)
    syntax highlighting?
    debugging?
    optimization in release mode?

    go through the asm file and take advantage of macros etc (debugging doesn't work with macros...)
    read through nasm and yasm manuals properly

- Go through the blend modes and verify that they are actually correct, seems to be some issues with some of them.
- Separate utility library
- Separate test library
- Rewrite TinyPTC to own code
  - Understand all the convert code first
  - Make Linux and Mac versions.
    - Android / iOS versions?
- 64 bit mode?
- Constify the code.
