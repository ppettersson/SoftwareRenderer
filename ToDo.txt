- Make Linux and Mac versions.
  - Need to remove all inline asm first.
  - Android / iOS versions?

- emms is problematic, it's only used for mmx, should we just take the hit and insert it where it's needed?
  Then it'll hit extra hard for functions that split up processing per line etc.

- Go through the blend modes and verify that they are actually correct, seems to be some issues with some of them.
  - Finish the mmx blend code: BlendLighten1, BlendDarken1, BlendScreen, BlendLighten, BlendDarken.
  - Is it possible to do Max(/Min/Abs)?

- Study how msvcrt's memcpy align memory for sse2.
- Remove pushad/popad, too slow and too many registers.
- Finish the new triangle renderer, half space method.
- Separate utility library
- 64 bit mode?
- Constify the code.
